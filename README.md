# Career-Essentials-In-Github
A repository I'm using to acquire GitHub skills and get the Career Essentials in GitHub certification

## Why I want to learn this knowledge
- Git is used everywhere
- GitHub actions seem very useful and while I have used them, I want a better understanding of them
- I want to explore what tools GitHub has and how to use them to enhance my coding projects
- I think Git and GitHub, as concepts, are very cool
